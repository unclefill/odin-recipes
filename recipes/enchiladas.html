    <p>This mole sauce is made with chocolate!</p>
    <p>This recipe will offer a sweeter than usual mole sauce, specifically because of the large amount of honey used. The dehydrated peppers taste quite bitter on their own, so adding sweetness is essential to creating a balanced dish. There is plenty of tartness from the lime juice and for additionl heat, be sure to add jalepenos the list of vegetables to be blended.</p>
